I am a diligent and inquisitive BSc Computer Science graduate with a strong professional interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science.

Alongside full time work , I am currently undertaking courses in Machine Learning, Mathematics for Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Statistics in order to build upon my university education in these fields.

This website is designed for me to share my data science projects that I work on in my spare time.
