## Welcome to my project library!

I have created this website to showcase the data science projects which I work on in my spare time. These are mostly practice datasets, used in order to build a portfolio of data science code and improve my skills. 

These are all coded in Python, with the aid of various packages such as NumPy, Pandas and Sklearn. I usually code these projects in plain Python3, and then transfer them into Jupyter Notebooks so they can be visualised easier here.

For the best viewing experience, I recommend viewing these pages on a computer, as the figures and code snippets can get very crowded on mobile devices.

I welcome any feedback on my work, and I am always eager to talk through data science and machine learning topics. If you would like to contact me, please either leave a comment at the bottom of any of my projects, or reach out to me via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidanhood0111/">LinkedIn Page</a>.

Many thanks for taking the time to have a look around!
