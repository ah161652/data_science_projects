## Welcome to my project library!

I have created this website to showcase the data science projects which I work on in my spare time. These are mostly practice datasets, used in order to build a portfolio of data science code and improve my skills. 

These are all coded in Python, with the aid of various packages such as NumPy, Pandas and Sklearn. I usually code these projects in plain Python3, and then transfer them into Jupyter Notebooks so they can be visualised easier here.

### Projects

Below is a list of my projects:

- [Regression: Prediciting house prices](data_science_projects/Regression/regression.ipynb)
- Classification
- Clustering/Reccomender Systems
